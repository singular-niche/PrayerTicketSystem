PrayerTicketSystem
==================

**PrayerTicketSystem** is an open source prayer ticket system forked from osTicket.
It is modified for use by intercessors to accept and respond to prayer requests in
the form of prayer tickets. Just like osTicket, PrayerTicketSystem seamlessly
integrates inquiries created via email, phone and web-based forms into a
simple easy-to-use multi-user web interface. Manage, organize and archive
all your prayer requests and responses in one place while providing your
clients with accountability and responsiveness.
