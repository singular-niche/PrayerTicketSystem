Welcome to PrayerTicketSystem 1.0
=================================
Some tasks are better left to a system administrator rather than a mindless
upgrade script. These are those remaining things that we'd rather you take
care of:

  * Verify that your attachments have been successfully migrated to the
    database and removed from your server's filesystem. Once you're
    comfortable that they're all migrated, and that the remaining files are
    all failed uploads or orphans from deleted tickets, remove the folder
    where attachments were uploaded to.

  * Remove the setup/ folder. This contains code you won't need for a live
    ticketing system.
